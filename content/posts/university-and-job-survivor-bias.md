There is a common saying inside the software engineering industry that has become a pet peeve of mine. I constantly see this kinds of posts, memes, and conversations with colleagues, in which it is debated if university "_prepares you for a job_". This statement is very vague on itself, but I see it always presented as 


> __*"Don't waste your time and money going to college because it is useless"*__. 


{{< figure caption="One of the memes I found the other day about the topic" src="/public/images/"the-university-doesn't-prepare-you-for-a-job"---a-survivor-bias-falacy-/4362ff0d6dd90acdece53605ba6731239d0f74c090c7c8d0bd141a250c06d5dc.png" >}}


I am firmly believe that this statements are not true. At least, that the reality is greatly misunderstood. For me this kind of thinking demonstrates a lack of maturity in your career growth, as you are not able to identify what is the valuable skills you are providing to your employer and where did they come from. This lack of vision of ourselves in the big picture can be a detriment to our further career development.

## What is a University?


Let's start from the beginning. Of course, let's go to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University#Definition):


> *A university (Latin: universitas, 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary)* __*education*__ *and* __*research*__ *which awards academic degrees in several academic disciplines.*


So there are two main purposes in this institutions: education and research. To me this is translated to:

* To preserve and spread humanity knowledge.
* To increase and question humanity knowledge.

In general, any major institution will be working towards this objectives with a great success. Assuming that, the question that tight this with our topic is:


> Are the industry and the academia knowledge different?


Of course it is out of the question that if you want to pursue a career in research, you will need to spend quite sometime in the university.

## The Industry Also Innovates and Creates New Knowledge


The tech and software industry has been an amazing place for innovation in the last 20 years. From the web technologies, mobile networks, smartphones, and the new era of ML. Those are things that have flourished in the industry.


So companies working for their own profit in the industry have also created knowledge. This is absolutely great. Of course then, this new information will not be imparted in the university degrees immediately, so it will be imposible to gain those skills in college. 


Does this means that college degrees in STEM education are obsolete? Short answer: of course they shouldn't. The fundamental principles of teaching in college degrees will still apply in a wide variety of places. For example:

* When you learn a new programming language, you won't start from scratch if you already knew how to program and interact with variables, functions, control flows...
* Different programming paradigms will repeat in multiple languages all the time. Like OOP or functional programming.
* Software patterns fundamentals will still apply, although they will have slight variations.

Even if you are learning a completely new thing, you are not starting from scratch. A college diploma is a guaranteed that you have a __strong base on your domain__. This base is constructed with teaching the fundamentals of mathematics and statistics, how processors and memory works, what is a byte, basic programming, basics of concurrence and parallelism...etc This is probably the most important part of your training as a professional in every field.


> __*Higher education is the base of your career. Don't underestimate the influence of strong fundamentals.*__


## College Teaches Useless Stuff

I partially agree on this point. Some college courses I took in the past were an absolute pain, but now I don't use a single thing from them. 


> However the problem is the definition of "__*useless*__" in this context. 


The definition is tricky because two things that I can identify:

1. Because the point I outlined before: everything can be contributing to your knowledge base even if you don't actually use it. Knowing a basic notion of TCP can help you diagnose a database connection problem as a Data Scientist.
1. Because the more you know, the better your decisions in your career and in your job. One of the things that I liked the most when I started was cybersecurity. However, I remember with great pain how the audit processes worked and all the standards issued by the ISO. This was one of the reasons that push me away from the path of a cybersecurity specialist, while also give me a view of how the role works which expands my capabilities of communicating with different teams.

## You Can Learn Everything on the Internet


This is a classic modern statement. I was a firm believer in it when I started working as a engineer. I had the felling that I was googling everything and

## Higher Education is a Privilege


## Higher Education Will Always "Add" to your Career


 The better the college degree and studies plan, the better the courses will be organized and the amount of "noisy", "useless" and "repetitive" content will be minimized. But even in the suboptimal circumstances, your
