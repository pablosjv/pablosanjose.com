Hello and nice to meet you!

I am Pablo. I am a Software Engineer with 5 years of professional experience based in Madrid, Spain.

As a first disclaimer, my personal website (that you are visiting right now) is a completely personal project that I started some time ago to try to set my online presence in my own way. What you will find here is exclusively my thoughts and opinions and are not related to my current employer or any other company.

I have studied Software Engineer here in Madrid. In the last 3 years, I have specialized in Data Analytics, Data Engineer and Machine Learning Engineering through my experience at [Clarity.ai](http://clarity.ai/) and with an MSc in Analytics by Georgia Tech. I am a true believer in the DevOps philosophy and right now I am happily bringing that to Data Science teams, through the productization and maintainance of ML models.

My programming language of choice is of course Python, but I have used multiple programming languages through my career and studies, such as: Go, Java, Scala, C++, C, Ada, Javascript, C#... and the list goes on! I always try to keep an open mind about the technologies I use, and I love to learn new things about almost anything.

Outside work, you can find me doing sports, playing guitar, and playing video games.
